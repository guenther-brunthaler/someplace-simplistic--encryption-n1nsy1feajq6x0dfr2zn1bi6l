$APP - encrypt and integrity-protect data or decrypt and verify it|
|
Usage (encryption): $APP [ <options> ] [ -- ] <psw_file> < <plaintext> > |
<ciphertext>.gc2|
|
Usage (decryption): $APP [ <options> ] [ -- ] <psw_file> <ciphertext>.cg2 > |
<plaintext>|
|
$APP encrypts or decrypts arbitrary data using the ARCFOUR-drop3072 stream |
cipher.|
|
<psw_file> is the pathname of a file containing a text pass phrase. It is |
safe to use the same pass phrase for many messages, because $APP will |
automatically create and apply a salt for every new encryption. Any newline |
characters present in <psw_file> will be skipped when $APP reads its contents |
as if they were not there. The pass phrase will not be used directly as the |
encryption key which would be dangerous with ARCFOUR. Instead, it will be |
subjected to a proper key derivation function.|
|
The encrypted ciphertext output will consist of a 32-octet (octets are 8-bit |
bytes) salt, followed by the encrypted data, followed by a 32-octet (256 bit) |
message authentication code (MAC).|
|
Nothing in the contents of the encrypted file gives any clue (except for the |
length) about its format or contents. This is intentional in order to |
maximize privacy. However, in case the encryption format should be made |
known, it is recommended to use a filename extension '.gc2' for the encrypted |
files.|
|
Encryption works on streams of arbitrary size, but decryption needs an actual |
file because it needs to be read twice: First for the MAC verification, next |
for the actual decryption. Only after MAC verification it is safe to assume |
that the encrypted data has not been maliciously modified.|
|
Options supported:|
|
-s <seed_file>: Use the seed from this file rather than generating one.|
-V: Show version information and exit.|
-h: Display this help and exit.|
|
$APP implements version 2 of the author's simplistic portable encryption |
scheme. It is simple enough to be implemented entirely using POSIX-defined |
command line utilities, at least for decryption.|
|
Encryption needs a 32-octet salt, which will be derived from a seed which |
must never repeat.|
|
The seed can be specified directly via option -s, which is useful when using |
a counter- or date-based nonce.|
|
Otherwise, $APP attempts to invoke an external helper script |
'$default_saltgen' with argument of 32 which is expected to return |
high-quality true-random octets. If no such utility is found either, $APP |
reads 32 octets from /dev/random as a last resort.|
|
Note that any <seed_file> is not used directly as the salt, but would rather |
be hashed into 32 octets by $APP as the salt. Therefore it does not really |
matter what size of format <seed_file> has, as long as its contents will |
never repeat. For instance, a file containing a simple counter which is |
incremented before every encryption would be fine as <seed_file>. The output |
of "date" written to a file would also do.|
|
Neither <psw_file> nor <seed_file> need to be regular files. They can also be |
special files like FIFOs or file descriptors in /dev/fd/*.|

seed_warning() {
	cat << ===
Warning: No seed has been specified via option -s and no entropy harvesting |
helper '$default_saltgen' has been found either. Falling back to /dev/random |
for obtaining a seed for salt generation.|

}

MAC_mismatch_message() {
	cat << ===
MAC verification failure!|
|
This means that this message has either been accidentally damaged or that it |
has been maliciously corrupted by an attacker.|
|
The latter is especially dangerous with a stream cipher like the one used to |
encrypt his message, because an attacker can precisely flip any particular |
bit of the decrypted message even without knowing the decryption key.|
|
The decrypted corrupt data might tell you lies like a wrong banking account |
number where to transfer funds to. Or it might even crash the application |
which is trying to open it, implanting a virus into your system.|
|
Therefore, it would be dangerous to decrypt this corrupt data file. So we |
just don't!|
|
Instead, try to get a new uncorrupted copy of the encrypted file.|
|
Or, if the file is very large and you don't want to transfer it again, ask |
the sender to send you error correction information for repairing the damage |
instead. The program "par2" can be used to create such information and use it |
to repair damaged files. The tool "rdiff" can do the same in a less efficient |
way. Depending on the situation, "rsync" and "zsync" might also help.|
