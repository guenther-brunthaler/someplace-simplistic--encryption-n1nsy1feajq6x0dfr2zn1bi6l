Test vectors for the original ARCFOUR algorithm:

* files i? are the binary inputs for the test
* files k? are the corresponding binary encryption keys
* files o? are the expected binary results of the encryption

"original" means that no "drop"-parameter is used (i. e. no 
initial part of the output keystream is dropped) and the 
modifications to the original key setup have no effect because 
the keys of the test vectors are too short for that.
